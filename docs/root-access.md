# Root Access

If you are reading this message you likely do not have **root** permissions on your device.

If you do not know what **root** is, [this article](https://www.androidauthority.com/root-android-277350/) explains what it is. _**I am not responsible for anything that may happen if you decide to root your device.**_

If your device is actually rooted, please check if this app was denied root access in your Superuser/Magisk/etc manager app.
